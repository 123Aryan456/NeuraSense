# NeuraSense

Welcome to NeuraSense, a project born out of my obsession with programming. It's an attempt at bringing actionable insights out of your python code(as for now). It could be a great interest to any curious developer interested in cool tech simply looking to simplify, intuit, and access the analysis.

## Why NeuraSense?

Ever stared at your Python code wondering:
	•	Is this efficient?
	•	Am I missing something obvious?
	•	Why does this feel so… messy?

I built NeuraSense to answer those questions. This tool doesn’t just analyze your code; it gives you insights, suggestions, and a roadmap to elevate your programming game.

## Key Features
	•	Static Code Analysis: Identify issues like unused variables, bad naming conventions, or inefficient loops.
	•	Code Optimization Suggestions: Get practical tips to make your code faster and more Pythonic.
	•	Readability Scores: Because clean code is happy code.
	•	Error and Vulnerability Detection: Spot potential bugs and security flaws before they become nightmares.
	•	Customized Reports: Export analysis in a neat, readable format for sharing with your team or just flexing.

# Wanna Contribute?

Look, I’m 18, and while I like to think I’m pretty good at this stuff, I know there’s always room for improvement. If you’ve got ideas, feature requests, or just want to geek out about programming, let’s collaborate.

# A Note from me

I built NeuraSense to help developers like you make your Python code better—not just functional, but exceptional.

If you like NeuraSense, give it a star ⭐, share it with a friend, or drop me a line. I’d love to hear your feedback, ideas, or just geek out about code.

Cheers,
Aryan
